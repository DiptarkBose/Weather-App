# README.md

This is our basic README. Here are the functionalities we discussed:

1. Weather data pollinng from some API.
2. Use GPS (sensor) to provide location to the Weather API
3. Maybe add Weather News (using some News API), so that both of us have an API to talk about in our doc.
4. Maybe a Backend Node.js that connects to MongoDB, wherein we can store Username/Passwords for Auth? Just a thought...
5. Any other ideas can be addded here!
